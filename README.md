How do I approach designing software and how do I approach developing programs?

This class being incredibly tough, taught me so much that I will take into my next coding courses. There was a lot of confusion in my code in the beginning where
if another person were to read it it wouldn't make sense. This hindered me as well when trying to add on to my code due to confusing myself throughout the course. 
About 5 or 6 weeks in it finally clicked and I was able to clean up my code, meaning I got ride of repeating lines that didn't need to be there, commented what 
lines did what, organized it in a thorough way where it was easy to find where to add more code, and overall just easier to read. This can be applied to my future 
courses where I'll start off trying to be more organized and comment more often than not. For this final project, the weeks/milestones leading up to it was insanely
rough. I watched many hours of youtube trying to put it all together. Once it was done, it was very rewarding. I may have spent some nights crying due to the pure
frustration this class was, but I was so happy to have a final project completed and the hard work paid off. 


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?


Computer science can help me in reaching my goals as I already work in the IT industry and need as much computer science skills as possible. I'm a business analyst 
and it can be a hard working job. Some days are rougher than others. This class alone taught me that the effort I put in is the effort it will output. I know that was
already a saying but I never really grasped it until this class. For my future educational pathway, this class taught me how to be more organized and to test more often
than not. I've always been an organized person, but after this class I now will try to be even more organized as one can get lost in their own work quite easily. These
organizational skills also go towards my proffesional pathway as I am working on a huge project right now and the more organized the better. There's so many hands in
the cookie jar that things get jumbled quickly, being organized can help this.
